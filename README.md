# Current Effects
The newest Trackmania has a number of special effects that can be applied to your car, including some helpers and many hinderances. It can be hard to keep track of what you currently have, especially in cases of LOL maps.

Showcase: https://youtu.be/0rzvJQJC8gc

## Currently working:
- Engine Off
- Forced Acceleration
- No Brakes
- No Grip
- No Steering
- Reactor Boost (yellow/red, up/down, last-second timer)
- Slow-Mo (all 4 levels)
- Turbo (all 5 levels, timer)
- Editor playtest
- Viewing replays (only if one is on-screen)
- Online (playing on servers)

## Still needed:
- Acceleration penalty
- ***Cruise Control***
- ***Fragile***
- Reactor Boost (full 6-second timer - the only reason I started this)
- Slow-Mo (timer)
- More settings (colors, etc.)
